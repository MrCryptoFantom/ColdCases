# About ColdCases
A Text-Based crime game about solving mysteries made by players just like you, using its custom, easy to understand, programming language.

Users play through a Case File that was either created by myself or another player, It's pretty strait forward. You can make custom cases to send to friends as well.
I designed the programming language to be as user friendly as possible while still being functional, I'll include the documentation I wrote to help people out.
